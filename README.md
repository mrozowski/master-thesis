## Machine learning
Machine learning focuses on creating computer programs that can analyze data and learn from it. Thanks to this skill, which is close to the human cognitive process, we can write systems that can learn on their own - and acquire experience in a similar way as humans.

## Data analysis
It is the process of transforming raw data into useful information. This involves analyzing patterns, anomalies, and correlations in large data sets using appropriate algorithms and tools.

## Program
The program uses machine learning and data analysis to detect heart disease. The application can analyze patient data and use it to diagnose the condition. Additionally, the program provides a report that provides a more detailed insight into the results of the predictive model.

As a machine learning model program uses a decision tree. I tested several ML models and the best result was from the decision tree. Also, it allows us to get information on how the decision was made and which parameters had the most impact.

## Conclusions
* Machine learning and data analysis have a huge impact on today's world and medicine.
* Through data analysis, large amounts of information can be extracted from even simple data sets.
* The Python language has a very wide range of applications.
* Random decision forest provides detailed information on how the result was achieved.
* Setting appropriate parameters when creating a decision forest model has a significant impact on the results achieved.
